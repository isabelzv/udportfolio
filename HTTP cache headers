    "no transform" tells CDN not to convert image or other doc formats.
    "public" lets the CDN know that the response of the origin server is not specific to the end user, so can be used for other clients requests.
    "max-age" age is seconds that an asset expires from cache. Here it is set relatively high, because requests to the site and relatively low (ave <1/hr).
    "s-maxage" is explicitly for the CDNs, will override max-age.
